# CS-250

Reflection:

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program starts by asking the right questions and truly understanding the problem the user is trying to solve. During this course, creating user stories helped frame user needs in a way that kept the focus on value and not just technical features. By writing stories from the user's point of view, it became easier to prioritize tasks and make decisions about what functionality mattered most. The structure of user stories, where we define the user, what they need, and why they need it, made sure that each piece of development work tied back to an actual user outcome.

When it comes to developing programs, I find that approaching it in small, iterative steps works best. Agile processes like Scrum encourage this by breaking down big goals into smaller pieces that can be delivered quickly. In my future development work, I plan to continue using Sprints, Sprint Reviews, and Retrospectives to stay on track and continuously improve. One of the biggest lessons from this course was how scaling frameworks like Scrum@Scale and Nexus keep teams aligned and focused even when projects become large and complex (Scrum Inc., 2022; Scrum.org, n.d.). Whether I am working on a small app or a large system, I plan to stay flexible, collaborate often, and adapt quickly to changing user needs.

Being a good team member in software development means more than just writing good code. It means communicating openly, giving and receiving feedback, and helping the team move forward even when challenges come up. During this course, I learned how important it is to be transparent about what you are working on, to step up when blockers appear, and to support others when they need help. Frameworks like Scrum@Scale put a big emphasis on respect, commitment, and cross-team collaboration, which are qualities I want to continue bringing into every project I am part of. Working as part of a strong team not only improves the product but also makes the development process more rewarding.
